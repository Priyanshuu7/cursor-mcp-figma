# MCP Figma Integration

This project demonstrates how to connect MCP (Modern Component Platform) to Figma and recreate a UI from a Figma design.

## How it Works
- The Figma design was used as a reference for layout, spacing, and component structure.
- UI components were built in React using Next.js and Tailwind CSS, matching the Figma design pixel-perfectly.
- shadcn/ui and lucide-react were used for accessible, reusable UI primitives and icons.
- The workflow involves analyzing the Figma file, extracting design tokens, and translating them into code using the MCP component system.

## Steps
1. **Connect to Figma:**
   - Use the Figma file link to inspect design details (spacing, colors, typography, etc).
2. **Componentize:**
   - Break down the Figma design into reusable React components.
3. **Build UI:**
   - Implement the components using shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS, and lucide-react, ensuring a pixel-perfect match.

This approach enables rapid, accurate UI development directly from Figma designs using MCP and modern React tooling.
